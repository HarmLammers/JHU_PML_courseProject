# JHU_PML_courseProject
JHU Data Science - Practical Machine Learning - course project

The project contains two RMD files, one for the html and one for pdf with minor changes.

I recommend to use the html output and the corresponding rmd - file:  
JHUPracticalMachineLearning_courseproject.  

The name is a continuous character string because of the generation of the html - file.
  
The prediction - set is the same as the problem - set of textfiles.
